## Task Tracker || Daily Task Manager
<img align="right" width="400" height="400" src="/assets/task-tracker-logo.png">
<p align="left">Task Tracker is a simple daily task manager, where users can organize their daily responsibilities in one place</p>

## Try It Out
<p>https://tiffmc1tasktracker.herokuapp.com/</p>

## Features
Users can add, edit, and/or delete their tasks upon completion

## Tech Stack
Task Tracker was created using:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): For creating a highly interactive user interface
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/): To build, store, and manage state containers
- [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/): To bind React and Redux
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): As our JavaScript runtime environment
- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/): A promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres to serve the model relations
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/): For deployment

## Future Improvement
- This is a personal task manager, which only serves one person. Would like to add functionality so that Task Tracker can be used simultaneously
- Create themes so that user can change background colors
- Add "importance" functionality so that users can tackle those tasks first
